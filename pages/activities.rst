Ambleside is a wonderful location and we particularly like the location of Merry Bank because it is close to the fells and yet also close to the village of Ambleside with all its wonderful attractions. Here are just some of our favourite things to do, but there are so many more! 

Walking
-------
There are so many wonderful walks that it can be difficult to decide which ones to do. It can be useful to have a map on your phone as well as in your rucksack. The Ordnance Survey (OS) Maps App can be useful or the Memory-Map app which also provides access to OS maps. Other walking apps include Outdooractive, which was formerly ViewRanger. 
`WalkLakes <https://www.walklakes.co.uk/>`_ is a great website which lists many walks graded according to their distance and difficulty and there are good maps on the site. They have an excellent `interactive map <https://www.walklakes.co.uk/maps2/>`_ that you can use to plot our a potential route and download GPS information - it is worth exploring this map. 

**Walks from the front door**
We love all of these; Loughrigg Fell, Wansfell Pike, Rydal Water, Grasmere, Stock Ghyll, High Sweden Bridge, Troutbeck, Red Screes, the Langdales, Helvellyn and Fairfield. Most are covered in the guides below and in The Southern Lakes - 40 shorter walks by Dominic North which you will find in Merry Bank. |br|
It can be useful to photograph the pages and map for the walk with your phone and using this as a guide when you are walking.|br|
Some of our favourite local routes from the front door are shown as red lines on the map below. |br|
Other sources of information include the Cicerone books (e.g. 5 Fantastic Fell Walks from Ambleside) and `Lakeland Leisure Walks <https://www.lakelandleisurewalks.co.uk/?Ambleside_Walks&normal>`_ ` who produce a series of short walk pamphlets. |br|
**Wansfell Pike** is well worth the climb. It takes around 45-60 minutes to get to the summit and from there you can walk back down the way you came or go down towards the lake, walking through Skelghyll Wood and then back to Ambleside. There are multiple other variations including walking across Wansfell Pike to Troutbeck. |br|
To start the walk upto Wansfell Pike, leave Stockghyll Court at the non-road end and turn left onto the path which will take you to Stockghyll Lane above the lower waterfalls. If you follow this road over a cattle grid then you will soon see steps and a footpath on the right. A very well marked path takes you to the summit of Wansfell Pike where there are superb views across Windermere in one direction and over to the higher fells in the other direction. |br|
Stock Ghyll Force is just across the road from Stockghyll Court and is well worth a look, especially if there has been plenty of rain recently. You can walk through the woods and emerge higher up Stockghyll Lane. If you turn left on the lane you will soon see the steps on the right of the road leading to the path up Wansfell Pike. If you turn right and go down the lane slightly you will reach  `Force Café <https://force.cafe>`_.  |br|

**Longer Walks**
The Fairfield horseshoe is a stunning walk as most of the walk is along the ridge of the horsehoe shaped route with spectalular views if the visibility is good. You can do the walk from Ambleside, but it is a good six hours or longer walk. 
The Langdale walks are all wonderful and there are multiple variations including a long walk to Scafell Pike from the `Old Dungeon Ghyll hotel <https://www.odg.co.uk/>`_ . You can drive to the start of the route but parking can be tight or take the excellent 516 bus from the bus interchange in Ambleside to the Old Dungeon Ghyll hotel – this doesn’t take much longer than driving there. 

Swimming
--------
Wild swimming can be done in Rydal Water, Loughrigg Tarn, Grasmere, Elterwater and of course Windermere. There is more information `here <https://www.onelakedistrict.co.uk/best-wild-swim-spots-in-ambleside>`_ and further guidance about swimming on the Lake District National Park `swimming pages <https://www.lakedistrict.gov.uk/visiting/things-to-do/water/swimming>`_


Coffee and snacks
-----------------
For something very local, try `Force Cafe <https://force.cafe/>`_ which is just up Stockghyll Lane and can be a very pleasant sun trap with great views and great food. |br|
`Grove Barn <https://grovebarnambleside.co.uk/>`_  Café is a little further up the lane and does great cakes, but check their webiste to see if it is open before setting off. |br|
The Giggling Goose- immediately you arrive at the bottom of Stockghyll lane across the road on your right- very relaxing to have hot soup by the side of the Ghyll. |br|
`Zeffirelli's <https://www.zeffirellis.com/>`_ is very comfortable and calm for coffee in the bar areas and dinner in the evening. 

Snacks mid-walk
---------------
`Chesters by the River <https://www.chestersbytheriver.co.uk/>`_ at Skelwith Bridge does 'to die for' bakes, both savoury and sweet. There is also a very nice upmarket shop selling a range of products from greetings cards to furniture. You can walk to Chesters via Loughrigg fell or Loughrigg tarn. |br|
`The Mortal Man <http://www.themortalman.co.uk/>`_ in Troutbeck is a good stopping place for a pint +/- lunch after climbing Wansfell Pike and walking down the other side of the pike to Troutbeck. You can walk back along a flatter route to Ambleside.  

Eating Out
----------
There are many other eating options in the hotels and restaurants. We haven't had a bad meal yet. `Zeffirelli's <https://www.zeffirellis.com/>`_ and `Fellini's <https://www.zeffirellis.com/food-drink/fellinis>`_ do great vegetarian food, so much so that many of their customers are not vegetarian. At peak times it is sensible to book a table for Zeffirelli's or Fellini's. 

An evening stroll
-----------------
If the weather is pleasant consider taking a stroll down to the lake to watch the sunset, perhaps while having a drink in the Waterhead Inn or Wateredge Inn gardens. You can also stroll around Borans Park or Galava, the Roman fort next to the park. You can do this from the non-road end of Stockghyll Court. Turn left out of the house and at the end of the court turn right down the path, then at the end of the path follow the road down hill and turn left at the bottom of the road. This road eventually brings you to the main road. Turn left onto this road and it is a short walk along this to the lake. You can also go further along the road past the youth hostel to the National Trust land which has access to the lake and is usually very peaceful. You can also get drinks at the youth hostel bar and drink them in their garden overlooking the lake. 


A Night Out
-----------
Cocktails, Jazz or a film at Zeffirelli's- sophistication and entertainment just a few minutes walk from home. There is often high quality live music at Zeffirelli's.
Drinks in the Golden Rule - relaxed, traditional pub just 6 minutes from home. 

Places to visit
---------------
There are excellent suggestions for places to visit on the `Lake District National Park website. <https://www.lakedistrict.gov.uk/visiting/places-to-go>`_ |br|

The Heaton Cooper Studio is well known and has a very nice café. You can walk or drive to Grasmere, but the 599 bus runs regularly from the bus interchange in Ambleside to Grasmere. Wordsworth house include `Dove Cottage <https://wordsworth.org.uk/>`_ in Grasmere and `Rydal Mount <https://www.rydalmount.co.uk/>`_ north of Ambleside. |br|

You can hire rowing or other boats near the Waterhead Pier at the head of the lake in Ambleside or at the waterfront in Bowness. 
There are regular `cruises <https://www.windermere-lakecruises.co.uk/>`_ of the lake running most days from the Waterhead Pier and stopping off at different places around the Lake.
