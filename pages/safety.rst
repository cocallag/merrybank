Outside 
-------

•	Please ensure the garage door is pushed gently but fully up to ensure is does not come down and injure you. 
•	Please walk slowly in the front garden if the weather is wet to avoid slipping on slates or grass. 
•	Please do not ascend the stone steps above the shingle patio in the back garden.


Inside
------

•	Please use hand rail when using the stairs.
•	Please use non slip mat and grab rail when using the shower and bath.
•	Please do not change the location of the TV but you may angle the screen.
•	Please mop up any water spillages with the mop in the drying cupboard as soon as possible both to avoid damage and also to prevent slipping.
•	If you do have an accident or are unwell please call 111 or 999 as appropriate.

 
Fire safety
-----------

•	Always shut the door to the main living room when you go to bed. This would help to prevent smoke or fire arising in the kitchen/ living room area affecting your escape route down the stairs. 
•	In the event of a fire raise the alarm.
•	There is a fire blanket in the kitchen on the side of the fridge/freezer. 
•	There is a fire extinguisher on the kitchen window ledge. 
•	The house has interlinked smoke detectors and if one is activated all the others will be triggered. There is also a carbon monoxide detector on the landing. The central heating/hot water boiler is in the airing cupboard on the landing. 
•	An emergency light will come on over the landing/stairway area if the alarms are triggered.
•	In the event of fire leave the building by the front door or rear door.
